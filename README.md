Diagnostic Center Bill Management System Application using 3-tier architecture on ASP.NET Web form.

This web application will manage billing activities for a small diagnostic center. Generally, small diagnostic offers several types of tests like Complete blood count, Lipid profile, Urine C/S-200, X-Ray LS Spine, USG Lower abdomen etc. Since bill processing for these types of tests requires paper work and is very error prone, we are offering this application to process it automatically from their side. Following are the stories (with score) for the mentioned application.
